# portfolio_live

 Welcome to the `portfolio_live` repository. Here I will be keeping `markdown` and `html` pages that would appear as part of my website. Experimental stuff are kept in a private repository then migrated here when they're ready for the public to see.

 Right now it's a bit barren, I will admit, but that would hopefully change soon. Oh and did I say, this is my first foray into GitHub?

 Anyway, in the meantime, you can view my actual portfolio website at <http://www.nathanielmelican.com>.
